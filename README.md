This is a  irect transfer system into an iPhone with very few mods.  
The original projector light was replaced with the LED light with the   
power supplied from the projector power supply.  
The projector sound as brought up to the top mounted audio jack   
that gets connected the iPhone via the HDMI dongle.
The projector and the iPhone have to be on a sturdy surface to prevent the vibrations from reaching the projector. A small tripod is also provided for iPhone. It takes a bit of patience and practice to align the iPhone to the projector Lens but once aligned no adjustments are required after that.
